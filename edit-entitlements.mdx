## Granting Entitlements

With the **"Edit entitlements"** button in Qonversion, you can grant users access to premium content for a specified duration without requiring a purchase or promo code. This feature proves valuable in many scenarios, such as offering beta users a free preview of content or effectively addressing customer support concerns.

1. Navigate to the [Customers](https://dash.qonversion.io/customers/) tab
2. Click on the customer whose entitlements you want to configure
3. Click the "+ Add" button to select a specific entitlement and the duration of time for which it will be active for this customer

<Info>
  Granted entitlements will be displayed in the API response with the "manual" source and will not have any particular event in the Events tab.
