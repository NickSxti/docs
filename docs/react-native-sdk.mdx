Install Qonversion React Native SDK to validate user receipts, and get in-app subscription analytics and third-party integrations.

## Install via npm

Qonversion SDK package is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-qonversion).

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  npm install react-native-qonversion --save
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If you don't have auto-linking enabled, link the SDK to the native project manually:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  react-native link react-native-qonversion
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Extra steps

### iOS

If you've installed the library using auto-linking, then all you need to do is run `pod install` from your iOS folder.

### Android

Include the `BILLING` permission in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file as follows:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  <uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Running with Expo

If you are using Qonversion in an Expo app you will have to create [Development Builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/).

<Warning>
  ### Solving `TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating ‘RNQonversion.storeSDKInfo’)`

  As Qonversion React Native SDK contains native modules, there is no option to run your app using Expo Go. Make sure you use Development Builds as described above to solve this issue.
</Warning>
