Qonversion automatically collects the attribution data for Apple Ads through its SDK and AdServices Framework. The attribution data and raw data export are available in the Qonversion Apple Ads dashboard.

## 1. Generate Apple Ads credentials

1. Create a user with the API Account Manager role in your Apple Ads [account](<https://app.searchads.apple.com/cm/app/ >) (you need the admin rights to create a user): Account Settings → User Management → Invite Users → Select the user role

2. Log in to your Apple Ads account using the user's credentials with API access created above. You need to create an **OAuth client** in the API settings. To generate private and public keys, please follow [Apple's Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_search_ads/implementing_oauth_for_the_apple_search_ads_api#3733114). Paste your public key including "BEGIN" and "END" headers to create client credentials. Download the private key, you will need it later: Account Settings → API → Client Credentials

<Warning>
  ### Create a user with the API Account Manager role

  If you authorize using the main account, the credentials screen might not always appear. To prevent this issue, create a user with an API access role and use that account to authorize and retrieve the public key.
</Warning>

3. Сopy and save `clientId`, `teamId`, `keyId`.
4. Fill **Public Key** with the public part of the certificate that you made in step 2.

## 2) Configure Qonversion with ASA credentials

1. Navigate to the [Apple Ads settings](https://dash.qonversion.io/project/apple-search-ads) in your Qonversion project

2. Provide your **Client ID**, **Team ID**, **Key ID**, **Private key** and save the information.

   1. Take **Client ID**, **Team ID**, **Key ID** from the Apple Ads account API settings page.
   2. Take **Private Key** from the private part of the certification mentioned above.
      1. Do not trim "-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----" and "-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----" from the private key. Past it in our Settings as is.

## 3. Configure SDK

### 3.1 Enable Data Collection

After you have completed the first three steps from the [Quick Start guide](https://documentation.qonversion.io/docs/quickstart) and have Qonversion SDK installed, enable data collection using the following SDK method:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  Qonversion.shared().collectAppleSearchAdsAttribution()
  ```

  ```bash bash
  [[Qonversion sharedInstance] collectAppleSearchAdsAttribution];
  ```

  ```bash bash
  Qonversion.getSharedInstance().collectAppleSearchAdsAttribution();
  ```

  ```bash bash
  Qonversion.getSharedInstance().collectAppleSearchAdsAttribution();
  ```

  ```bash bash
  Qonversion.GetSharedInstance().CollectAppleSearchAdsAttribution();
  ```

  ```bash bash
  Qonversion.getSharedInstance().collectAppleSearchAdsAttribution();
  ```

  ```bash bash
  Qonversion.getSharedInstance().collectAppleSearchAdsAttribution();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  ### Tips

  1. Run `collectAppleSearchAdsAttribution` method regardless of user App Tracking Transparency (ATT) response; it allows us to collect attribution in the most accurate way
  2. Make sure you are using Qonversion iOS SDK version 2.18.2 or above
</Warning>

### 3.2 Import AdServices framework

Starting with iOS 14.3, Apple Ads campaigns are measured through a new self-attributing integration based on the [AdServices framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ad_services).
