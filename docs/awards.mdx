## Best Practices

* **Be authentic** — only display awards your app has actually received
* **Use sparingly** — one prominent award badge is more effective than many
* **Match context** — use App Store awards for iOS users, Play Store for Android
* **Position strategically** — place near CTAs to boost conversion
* **Keep it current** — highlight recent awards over older ones
* **Combine with reviews** — pair awards with star ratings for maximum trust
* **Respect guidelines** — follow Apple's and Google's trademark guidelines

<Info>
  Ensure you have actually received the award before displaying it. Falsely claiming awards violates App Store guidelines and damages user trust.
