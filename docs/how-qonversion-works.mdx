title: "How Qonversion Works"
description: "Qonversion provides the complete toolset to build, analyze, and grow your mobile subscription business. There are two modes of using Qonversion:"
---

## 1. Subscription Management Mode

Use Qonversion SDK or API methods to process your In-App & Web purchases and to manage user access to the premium features. Qonversion validates user purchases and provides your mobile- or web-based app with an accurate entitlement status. You can quickly implement purchases without headaches with StoreKit or Google Play Billing Library, and you don't need to build your server to validate subscriptions.

→ See the details of setting the SDK and making purchases in [Subscription Management Mode](https://documentation.qonversion.io/docs/subscription-management-mode).

## 2. Analytics Mode

Use Qonversion with your in-house entitlement management to get comprehensive subscription analytics, user engagement tools (like A/B testing and no-code builder), and send data to leading marketing, analytics, and engagement platforms.

→ See the [Analytics Mode quick start guide](https://documentation.qonversion.io/docs/analytics-mode).

<Info>
  ### Subscription Management Mode includes Analytics Mode

  Subscription Management Mode includes everything from Analytics Mode. In case you already have in-app subscriptions implemented and are not ready to change your current in-app subscription flow, use Analytics Mode.
