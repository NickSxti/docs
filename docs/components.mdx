description: "Every screen in the No-Code Builder is made up of components — reusable, modular elements that define structure, content, and behavior."
---

You can combine components freely to build anything from a single-page paywall to a multi-screen onboarding flow.

Each component supports a unique set of properties, which can be configured in the Right Panel. Below you’ll find an overview of all available components, grouped by category, with quick links to their common use cases and key properties.

* Holding text, buttons, and images together
* Structuring responsive paywall layouts

**Key properties:**

* Action
* Layout (direction, distribution, wrap, gap)
* Alignment
* Position (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky)
* Size (fill, fit, auto, fixed)
* Spacing (margin, padding)
* Background, Border, Shadow
* Selected State (if linked to product)

<Info>
  **Tip:** Use containers as “cards” for product blocks or grouped pricing sections.

## Header / Footer (Pre-Built)

Pre-designed layout sections that maintain consistent structure across screens.

* **Header**: Ideal for app logos, titles, or progress indicators.

**Key properties:**

* **Alignment** – controls horizontal content placement (Start, Center, End).
* **Padding / Background** – adjust internal spacing and visual styling.
* **Typography** – inherit or override font family, weight, and color for text elements.
* **Static Position** – ensures Header and Footer stay fixed to screen boundaries (not scrollable).

### Best Practices

* **Start simple:** use pre-built containers and headers to create clean layouts.
* **Use variables** inside Text or Button components for dynamic pricing.
* **Link product actions** early (Select Product, Make Purchase) to test your screen logic.
* **Preview frequently**: test responsiveness on iOS, Android, and tablet devices.

## Prebuilt Components

Prebuilt components are ready-to-use component templates designed to accelerate paywall creation. Instead of assembling individual elements, you can drop in a complete, styled product block and customize it to match your brand.

***

Each template comes with:

* **Pre-configured structure** with placeholder content
* **Default and selected states** with automatic styling
* **Professional design** following Qonversion best practices
* **Full customization** — every property can be modified

***

### How to Add a Prebuilt Component

1. Open the **Left Sidebar** in the Builder.
2. Navigate to **Components** section.
3. Select a category (e.g., **Product Blocks**).
4. Browse the visual previews to find your preferred layout.
5. **Click** on a template to add it to your canvas.

![](/images/docs/6bc0f61be0def01917c03075ce60b45341c03706683e0bcc608d8e0c8e87d3cd-SCR-20251217-nwhe.png)

<Info>
  Prebuilt Components are ideal for quickly prototyping screens or getting started with proven layouts. You can always customize every aspect after adding them to your canvas.
</Info>

### Product Selection States

Product Block templates include automatic state-based styling:

| State              | Description                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Default**        | Normal appearance when the product is not selected            |
| **Select Product** | Highlighted appearance when the user taps/selects the product |

<Frame caption="Default vs Selected state comparison">
  <img src="<!-- UPLOAD: states-comparison.png -->" />
</Frame>

State changes are handled automatically when:

* User clicks/taps a product in the live paywall
* You preview the screen in the Builder

**Visual indicators for selected state typically include:**

* Border color change (purple accent)
* Text color emphasis
* Radio/checkbox fill
* Background tint adjustment

You can customize both states in the **Right Panel → States** section when a product container is selected.

***

### Customization

After adding a prebuilt component, you have full control over every element:

### Styling

* Colors (background, text, borders)
* Typography (font family, size, weight)
* Spacing (padding, margin, gap)
* Border radius and shadows

### Content

* Product titles and descriptions
* Price display format
* Badge text and positioning
* Feature list items and icons

### Behavior

* Linked products (connect to your actual store products)
* Default selected product
* Action on tap (Select Product, Make Purchase)

<Info>
  Remember to link each product container to your actual Qonversion products before publishing. Templates use placeholder product IDs that need to be updated.
</Info>

***

### Best Practices

* **Start with a template** that matches your goals, then customize
* **Link products early** — connect to real products before extensive styling
* **Test both states** — preview how default and selected states look together
* **Use badges strategically** — highlight your recommended plan with discount or "Best Value" badges
* **Keep feature lists scannable** — 3–5 features per plan is optimal for mobile
* **Preview on multiple devices** — use the device selector to check iOS, Android, and tablet layouts
