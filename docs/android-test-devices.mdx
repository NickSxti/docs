**1. Test devices** You can use both physical devices and emulators to run your app and test in-app purchases. Make sure that the emulator has the Play Store installed. You can check that by selecting **Tools->AVD Manager** in Android Studio.

**2. Test account** The test account from the [License testing](/docs/license-testing) step must be added to the test device **first**.

**3. Add a PIN if needed** When you make an in-app purchase for the first time, Google may ask you to verify your account.
