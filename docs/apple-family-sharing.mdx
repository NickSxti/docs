To begin, you can visit App Store Connect to turn on Family Sharing for a specific product. You can navigate to your apps page and select 'Turn On' in the Family Sharing section. Note that once you turn on Family Sharing for a product, you cannot turn it off.

Qonversion [Subscription Management mode](/docs/subscription-management-mode) supports Family Sharing out-of-the-box. You just need to set up [your products and entitlements](/docs/subscription-management-mode#1-configure-products--entitlements). Family Sharing will be available automatically.

## Family Sharing Implementation

1. After the initial purchase, every family member will receive the transaction in`func paymentQueue(_ queue: SKPaymentQueue, updatedTransactions transactions: [SKPaymentTransaction])` method with `restored` type

2. You will only see the transactions from the first user who made a purchase in the Qonversion dashboards.
