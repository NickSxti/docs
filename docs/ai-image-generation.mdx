Create beautiful, on-brand visuals for your paywalls and onboarding screens — without leaving the Builder and without opening a design tool.

# AI Image Generation

Generate high-quality visuals directly inside the Builder using text prompts.

**What you can use it for**

* Abstract gradients and brand backgrounds
* Hero visuals for paywalls
* Illustrations for onboarding steps
* Simple icons or decorative elements
* Quick concept sketches before you commit to a final asset

Generated images appear in your **Gallery** and can be added to Canvas, or deleted at any time.

## Prompt tips (that actually help)

Great results don’t require long descriptions. Keep things short and visual:

* Mention a style: “minimal”, “premium”, “flat illustration”, “soft gradient”.
* Mention a mood: “calm”, “playful”, “energetic”.
* Mention colors: “lavender + teal”, “black + neon purple”.
* For paywalls: “clean background, no text”.
* For onboarding: “centered composition”.

**Examples you can paste:**

* “Minimal abstract gradient, violet and deep blue, subtle glow, soft shapes.”
* “Cute playful illustration of a smartphone, bright pastel palette.”
* “Premium wave background, glassy texture, purple tones.”

***

## Daily quota

To keep performance stable, there’s a simple project-wide limit:

* 10 generations **per project** per day
* Resets at 00:00 UTC

Your remaining quota is shown next to the Generator. When it reaches zero, the UI clearly indicates that you’re out, and it reactivates automatically after the reset.
