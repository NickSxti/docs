title: "Rate Limits"
description: "Our SDKs include rate limit checks for API requests from the following versions. It's aimed at protecting our API from unexpected DoS attacks from SDKs due to unintended usage."
---

| Platform     | Version |
| ------------ | ------- |
| iOS          | 5.1.1   |
| Android      | 6.1.1   |
| React Native | 6.1.0   |
| Flutter      | 7.1.0   |
| Unity        | 6.1.0   |
| Cordova      | 4.1.0   |
| Capacitor    | 0.1.0   |

Every endpoint and every set of arguments separate the limits. The count of identical API requests per second is limited to 5. Exceeding this amount will cause a `RateLimitExceeded` error, described [here](doc:handling-errors).

If you receive the error mentioned above, ensure you don't call Qonversion SDK methods multiple times from several threads on each screen/view render method, etc.
