## Redeeming Apple Offer Codes

Users on iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 and later can redeem offer codes on the App Store through a one-time code redemption URL or within your app if you’ve implemented the `presentCodeRedemptionSheet` API.

Apple recommends using offer codes directly in your app via a redemption sheet.

Present the Offer Code redemption sheet to allow your users to redeem Offer Codes.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  Qonversion.shared().presentCodeRedemptionSheet()
  ```

  ```bash bash
  [[Qonversion sharedInstance] presentCodeRedemptionSheet]
  ```

  ```bash bash
  Qonversion.getSharedInstance().presentCodeRedemptionSheet();
  ```

  ```bash bash
  Qonversion.getSharedInstance().presentCodeRedemptionSheet();
  ```

  ```bash bash
  Qonversion.GetSharedInstance().PresentCodeRedemptionSheet();
  ```

  ```bash bash
  Qonversion.getSharedInstance().presentCodeRedemptionSheet();
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  ### Set up offer codes

  Set up the offer codes before testing. See the details on setting up offer codes [here](https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev6a098e4b1).
</Warning>

## Handling Results

If you need to get the results immediately after a user enters a promo code, please check the [deferred purchases](/docs/deferred-purchases) documentation. If a promo code was successfully applied, `checkEntitlements()` returns the updated entitlements.
