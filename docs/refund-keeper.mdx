## What is Refund Keeper?

When a user requests a refund for an in-app purchase, Apple reviews their app usage data to determine whether to approve or deny it. If the subscription was actively used, Apple may still approve the refund unless the developer provides additional data to justify rejecting it.

**Refund Keeper** automates this process, giving Apple a complete picture of how the subscription was used—reducing unjustified refunds and protecting your earnings.

## How it works

1. A user requests a refund through the App Store.
2. Apple sends a notification asking for transaction and usage details.
3. If no response is provided, Apple will likely approve the refund by default.
4. **Refund Keeper** automatically processes these requests and submits the necessary app usage data to Apple.
5. With better insights, **Apple is less likely to approve unjustified refunds**, keeping more revenue in your hands.
