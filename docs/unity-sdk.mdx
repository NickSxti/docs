## Install via Git URL

Available starting from Unity 2018.3. Just add this line to the *Packages/manifest.json* file of your Unity Project:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  "dependencies": {
      "com.qonversion.unity": "https://github.com/qonversion/unity-sdk.git#9.0.1"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Install via OpenUPM

Qonversion SDK package is available on the [openupm registry](https://openupm.com/). You can install it via [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli).

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  openupm add com.qonversion.unity
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Install Native Dependencies

Make sure your project contains the External Dependencies Manager package. Otherwise, iOS & Android dependencies won't be resolved. This can result in a package import issues. Here are the steps describing how to install the External Dependency Manager:

1. Download the last version of the [External Dependencies Manager](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver/tags) package.
2. In the Unity Editor click **Import package** -> **Custom package**
3. Choose a file with the `.unitypackage` dependency from the folder you've downloaded before and install it.

After the installation, do the following:

1. For iOS - **Assets** -> **External Dependency Manager** -> **iOS Resolver** -> **Install Cocoapods**
2. For Android - **Assets** -> **External Dependency Manager** -> **Android Resolver** -> **Resolve**

Now you are ready to build and run your project!
