## Install the library

The recommended way to install the Qonversion library for Android is with a build system like Gradle. The library is distributed via [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org).

Add the Qonversion library to the dependencies section in your app **build.gradle**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  dependencies {    
       implementation 'io.qonversion.android.sdk:sdk:8.+'
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Or check the current release version on [Github](https://github.com/qonversion/android-sdk/releases) if you want to use a specific version.
