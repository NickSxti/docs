## Proxy URL

Set proxy URL to receive all incoming Apple App Store or Google Play Notifications on your side, proxying through Qonversion infrastructure. That could be useful if you want to handle Apple's or Google's server-to-server notifications on your server in addition to the Qonversion service.
