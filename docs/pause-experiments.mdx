In contrast to one-time purchases, alterations in a recurring revenue model can influence an app's financial health for extended periods, ranging from weeks to years. Even minor modifications can accumulate over time, resulting in notable shifts in revenue.

Therefore, when experimenting with Qonversion, you might consider halting the exposure of new users to the A/B test without ending the experiment altogether.

We advise using the **Pause** button if this situation applies to you. By doing so, Qonversion:

* Continues to send variant-related data to your app for users already involved in the test.
* Sets the traffic allocation percentage to zero, ensuring the A/B test impacts no new users.
