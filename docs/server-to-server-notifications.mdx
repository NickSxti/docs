Qonversion checks user receipts regularly and does not require server-to-server (s2s) notifications from Apple. However, using server-to-server (s2s) notifications can help deliver subscription events faster.

## Get Notification URL

Navigate to your Qonversion [project settings](https://dash.qonversion.io/project-settings/stores). Copy the server-to-server (s2s) notification URL.
