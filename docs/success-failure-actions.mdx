## Overview

Success and Failure Actions allow you to define custom behaviors that occur after a purchase or restore action completes in your No-Code screens.

By default:

* **On Success**: The screen closes (`Close All`)
* **On Failure**: Nothing happens, the user stays on the screen (`None`)

With custom Success/Failure Actions, you can override these defaults to create more engaging user experiences.

***

## Available Actions

The following actions can be configured as Success or Failure handlers:

| Action         | Description                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **None**       | Do nothing, stay on the current screen              |
| **Close**      | Close the current screen only                       |
| **Close All**  | Close all No-Code screens                           |
| **Navigate**   | Navigate to another No-Code screen                  |
| **Open URL**   | Open a URL in the browser                           |
| **Deep Link**  | Open a deep link in your app                        |
| **Go to Page** | Navigate to another page within a multi-page screen |

***

## Supported Actions

Success and Failure handlers can be configured for the following actions:

* **Make Purchase** — triggered when a user initiates a product purchase
* **Restore** — triggered when a user restores previous purchases

***

## Platform-Specific Configuration

When **Platform-Specific Actions** is enabled, you can configure different Success/Failure behaviors for iOS and Android platforms independently.

***

## Minimum SDK Versions

Success and Failure Actions require the following minimum SDK versions:

| Platform     | Minimum Version |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| iOS          | 6.5.0           |
| Android      | No-Codes 1.5.0  |
| Flutter      | 11.3.0          |
| React Native | 10.3.0          |
| Unity        | 9.2.0           |
| Cordova      | 7.2.0           |
| Capacitor    | 1.2.0           |

<Info>
  ### **Note**

  If you're using an older SDK version, the default behavior will be applied:

  * Success: Close all screens
  * Failure: Stay on the screen
</Info>

***

## Configuration

To configure Success/Failure Actions in the No-Code Builder:

1. Select a component with a **Make Purchase** or **Restore** action

2. In the **Action** section of the right sidebar, you'll see:

   * **On Success** — action to execute after successful completion
   * **On Failure** — action to execute after failure

3. Select the desired action for each case

4. If the action requires a value (e.g., URL, screen ID), enter it in the corresponding field

## Best Practices

* **Success Actions**: Consider navigating to a thank-you screen or closing all screens to return users to your app
* **Failure Actions**: Keep users on the screen (`None`) so they can retry, or navigate to a help/support screen
* **Platform Differences**: Use platform-specific actions when iOS and Android require different post-purchase flows
