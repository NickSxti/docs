# 1. Create experiment from configuration

If you do not have [Remote Config](https://dash.qonversion.io/ab-testing/remote-configs) created yet, please, make it first.

After you have your configuration launched, you can start experiments based on it:

1. Find the configuration's context menu.
2. Click the "Create Experiment" button.
3. Adjust relevant keys to set up your new app behavior.
4. [Validate change](/docs/launch-experiments#test-changes-before-launch) before app release.
5. [Set traffic level](/docs/launch-experiments#3-adjust-traffic-level) and [launch the experiment](/docs/launch-experiments#4-launch-the-setup).

# 2. Create configuration from experiment

Once your hypothesis is validated, you might want to create a new Remote Configuration containing new payload or segmentation settings without additional app releases.

With this in mind, we have built a seamless approach that enables you to create new configurations from the experiment interface. **End** your experiment and select the **Create Remote Config** option.

# 3. Archive old Remote Config

After creating a new configuration during Step #2, you have two similar entities running:

* The one you started from during [Step #1](/docs/launch-test-from-remote-config#1-create-experiment-from-configuration).
* The one you have launched during [Step #2](/docs/launch-test-from-remote-config#2-create-configuration-from-experiment).

We highly recommend archiving the old configuration (from step #1) to avoid unexpected behavior. To accomplish this:

1. Follow the [Remote Config](https://dash.qonversion.io/ab-testing/remote-configs) page in Qonversion dashboard.
2. Find and click on the previously created configuration.
3. Use the **Archive** button to stop it from running.

# 4. Repeat

Congratulations! Following the abovementioned steps, you have completed your first *configuration -> experiment -> rollout* cycle. Now, you can leverage remotely configured onboarding flows, paywalls, or pricing to grow your in-app revenue. Moreover, our concept allows you to iterate without app releases.
