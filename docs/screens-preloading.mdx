title: "Screens Preloading"
description: "When showcasing your No-Code screens with Qonversion, there is typically a delay as the content is fetched from our API. This latency can impact user experience, making it crucial to minimize the time it takes for screens to become visible. To address this challenge, we offer a screen preloading feature through our SDK."

This functionality allows you to preemptively load the necessary screens before they are displayed to the user. By leveraging this capability, you can ensure that your No-Code screens are ready for instant display, significantly improving performance and user engagement. With preloaded screens, your application can provide a seamless experience, as users will not have to wait for content to be retrieved during interaction.

In the No-Codes Builder, you can choose to mark the screen as preloadable. Simply navigate to Settings -> General, enable the specified option, and then save your changes.

With this setup, your screen will be fully loaded following the SDK initialization and will be prepared by the time you're ready to display it. That's truly all that's required. No coding necessary!

Please note that we impose a limit of 20 preloadable screens per project to avoid excessive network load on users.
