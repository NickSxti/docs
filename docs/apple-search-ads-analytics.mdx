## Apple Ads Analytics Overview

Qonversion collects Apple Ads advertising attribution data so you can accurately measure the effectiveness of your campaigns and see exactly how much revenue each Apple Ads campaign and keyword generates. Qonversion Apple Ads tool tracks all critical metrics required for effective user acquisition on Apple's platform.

Qonversion accurately tracks in-app events, including trial conversions, subscription renewals, and in-app purchases, to define top-performing campaigns and keywords. Qonversion also shows you the data on ad spend, CPA, total revenue, and ROAS. The attribution dashboard leverages Apple Ads API and Ad Services framework, SDK data, and server-side receipt validation. Qonversion ASA attribution works independently of the SKAdNetwork.
