## Install SDK

Qonversion supports Cocoapods, Carthage, and Swift Package Manager to package your dependencies as a framework.

## Install via Cocoapods

Add dependency to `Podfile`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  pod 'Qonversion'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Run `pod install` in the project directory to download the dependency.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  pod install
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Install via Carthage

To integrate SDK into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  github "qonversion/qonversion-ios-sdk"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

After that, run the Carthage update to build the framework and drag the built Qonversion.framework into your Xcode project.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  carthage update
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Install via Apple Swift Package Manager

Open Xcode, go to **File → App packages...** and enter the package URL `https://github.com/qonversion/qonversion-ios-sdk` to the search bar to import the package.
