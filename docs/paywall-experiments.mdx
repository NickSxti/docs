Qonversion Experiments are designed for revenue-focused A/B testing for subscription apps to quickly discover if **new pricing, paywall UI, or even new onboarding flow positively impacts your app's revenue**. Qonversion Experiments can be used with your existing subscription payments flow. You can start running advanced subscription app experiments to validate your growth hypothesis in under 30 minutes.

# 1. Flexible variants configuration

Our goal is to provide as flexible variants configuration as possible:

* Experiments' in-app values allow you **to set up any appearance of your app's paywall** and even the onboarding steps before the paywall if required.
* Variant weights allow you to decide what share of your users are exposed to each variant. **You are not limited to a default evenly split strategy**.

# 2. Target the right user segments

Qonversion A/B testing offers flexible user segmentation:

* Test hypotheses for **specific countries** to find the most effective pricing strategy.
* Target either **new users** or **particular subscription owners** to determine which introductory offers and upgrades work best.
* Run A/B testing for a specific share of your active users to be able to run **several experiments simultaneously**.
* And [other options](/docs/launch-experiments#segment-your-users).

# 3. Analyze experiment results

We believe each experiment should be analyzed in two ways:

* With **a strict focus on the primary metric** you aim to improve. Avoiding data peeking and reducing correlated metrics noise are crucial to making accurate decisions during data collection.
* With convenient access to all the data including all relevant subscription metrics. So you can be 100% sure when you accept or reject the hypothesis.
