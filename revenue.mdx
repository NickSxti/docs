### MRR

The Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) chart shows the normalized monthly revenue from all active subscriptions for the selected dates. The MRR chart includes only subscriptions with auto-renewal turned on. For normalizing subscriptions' prices to a month, we use the following multiples depending on a subscription duration:

* Weekly subscription multiple: 4.35,
* Monthly subscription multiple: 1.0,
* Two months subscription multiple: 0.5,
* Three months subscription multiple: 0.33,
* Six months subscription multiple: 0.166,
* Annual subscriptions multiple: 0.083.

The chart's title shows your MRR at the end of the selected period. The percentage reflects the change in monthly recurring revenue during the selected period. In the example below, MRR equals $120,711 on the 31st of May. That is 68.58% higher than on the 1st of May.

### MRR Movement

MRR Movement helps you understand how subscriber base changes affect your monthly recurring revenue over time. This chart shows the revenue change caused by new paid subscriptions (above zero), and churned or cancelled subscriptions (below zero), i.e., expired, refunded or cancelled subscriptions.

The chart's title shows the net recurring revenue during the selected period; the percentage shows how this value changed compared to the previous period of the same length. In the example below, the MRR increased by $48,106, which is 61.88% higher than the growth in the previous period of the same length (31 days).
