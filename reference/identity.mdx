The **Identity** system lets you link a Qonversion User ID to your own authentication system's user ID. This enables cross-platform access — a user who logs in on both iOS and Android can share the same entitlements.

## How it works

1. A user installs your app → Qonversion SDK generates a `QON_` prefixed user ID
2. The user logs into your system → you call `identify()` with your user ID
3. Qonversion links the two IDs together
4. On another device, calling `identify()` with the same ID restores their entitlements

## Identity object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Your custom user identity ID |
| `user_id` | string | Qonversion User ID linked to this identity |

## Available endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/identities/{identity_id}` | Retrieve a Qonversion user by your identity ID |
| POST | `/identities/{identity_id}` | Create or link an identity to a Qonversion user |

## Authentication

All Identity endpoints require a **Project Key** in the `Authorization` header.
