A **User** in Qonversion represents a single app user across platforms. Each user has a unique Qonversion User ID (prefixed with `QON_`) that is automatically generated by the SDK on first launch.

## Key concepts

- **Qonversion User ID** — Auto-generated identifier (e.g., `QON_7791a27fc4e747412381842b36a`). This is the primary key for all API operations.
- **Environment** — Each user belongs to either `prod` (production) or `sandbox` environment.
- **Identity** — Users can optionally be linked to your own user ID system via the [Identity API](/reference/identity).

## User object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Qonversion User ID |
| `identity_id` | string | Your custom user identity (if set) |
| `created` | integer | Creation timestamp (Unix epoch seconds) |
| `environment` | string | `prod` or `sandbox` |

## Available endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/users/{id}` | Retrieve a user by Qonversion User ID |
| POST | `/users/{id}` | Create a new user with a specified ID |

## Authentication

All User endpoints require a **Project Key** in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.
