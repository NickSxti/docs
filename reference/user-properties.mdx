**User Properties** are key-value pairs attached to a user. They are used for segmentation, analytics filtering, and powering third-party integrations (e.g., sending user emails to Mailchimp or attribution IDs to AppsFlyer).

## Defined vs Custom properties

- **Defined properties** — Qonversion-reserved keys prefixed with `_q_` (e.g., `_q_email`, `_q_appsflyer_user_id`). These power built-in integrations.
- **Custom properties** — Any key you define for your own segmentation needs.

See the full list of defined properties in the [User Properties guide](/docs/user-properties).

## User Property object

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `key` | string | Property identifier. Defined keys start with `_q_` |
| `value` | string | Property value |

## Available endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/users/{id}/properties` | Retrieve all properties for a user |
| POST | `/users/{id}/properties` | Set one or more properties on a user |

## Authentication

All User Properties endpoints require a **Project Key** in the `Authorization` header.
