**Products** in Qonversion represent the in-app purchases and subscriptions you sell across platforms. Each product links to store-specific identifiers (App Store, Google Play, Stripe) and is used to configure entitlements, offerings, and experiments.

## Key concepts

- **Product UID** — Your unique identifier for the product in Qonversion (e.g., `premium_monthly`).
- **Product type** — `0` = Subscription With Promo Period, `1` = Regular Subscription, `2` = Non-Recurring Purchase.
- **Duration** — For subscriptions: `0` = Weekly, `1` = Monthly, `2` = 3 Months, `3` = 6 Months, `4` = Annual.
- **Store IDs** — Each product can be linked to Apple, Google, and Stripe product identifiers.
