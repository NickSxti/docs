The **Purchases** endpoint lets you record Stripe subscription purchases for a user. This is used when processing web payments through Stripe — after a successful Stripe checkout, send the purchase data to Qonversion so entitlements are granted and analytics are tracked.

## When to use this endpoint

- You have a **Stripe integration** and process payments on the web
- After receiving a successful payment from Stripe, you send the purchase details to Qonversion
- Qonversion then grants the appropriate entitlements and tracks the revenue

For native mobile purchases (App Store, Google Play), the SDK handles purchase recording automatically.
