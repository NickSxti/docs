---

The Qonversion REST API follows REST standards. It has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.qonversion.io/v3
```

## API Sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Users | Retrieve and create Qonversion users |
| User Properties | Manage user-level attributes for segmentation and analytics |
| Identity | Cross-platform user identity management |
| Entitlements | Retrieve, grant, and revoke premium access |
| Purchases | Record Stripe purchases |
| Products | Manage Qonversion dashboard products |
| Analytics | Revenue, subscriptions, and user analytics |
| Customers | Customer data and aggregated metrics |

## Request Format

All requests must include:
- `Authorization` header with a Bearer token
- `Content-Type: application/json` header (for POST/PUT/DELETE requests)

## Response Format

All responses are JSON-encoded. Successful responses return the requested resource directly. Error responses follow a consistent [error format](/reference/handling-api-errors).
