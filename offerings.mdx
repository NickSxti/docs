description: "Offerings are designed as a remote configuration to present particular products on specific paywalls. Moreover, you can change the products without additional app releases."
---

For example, you can offer one set of products on a paywall immediately after an onboarding flow is completed and another with discounts if a user has not converted later.

Qonversion Offerings do not require [Subscription Management Mode](subscription-management-mode). However, they enable the following features:

* Run pricing A/B tests
* Change products offered to your users without extra app releases

## Сreate an Offering

1. Navigate to the [Offerings](https://dash.qonversion.io/remote-configs/offerings) in your Qonversion account. Tap the Create offering button.

2. Fill in the offering details:

   1. Name: short custom description field.
   2. Offering ID: unique offering ID used by the Qonversion SDK to get associated products
   3. Products: list of products that are linked to the offering. The chosen order of the products transfers to the response of Qonversion SDK's [offerings](displaying-products#displaying-products) method.

### Attach products

Offerings are based on the Products you could create previously to manage your entitlements by using [Qonversion Subscription Management Mode](subscription-management-mode). Please, follow [Create Products guide](create-products) to learn about creating a new product entity.
