## Filters and Groups

Filters enable you to narrow down charts to display data that aligns with specific attributes. This feature is handy when examining the performance of particular properties, such as a specific country, currency or app version.

On the other hand, groups allow you to dissect the overall totals in Analytics charts into distinct data segments. This functionality proves valuable when comparing the performance of specific properties.
