The Qonversion Monitoring page is a customizable dashboard allowing you to track your app's critical metrics. You can choose which metrics to display, such as Sales, MRR, Active Subscriptions, New-User-to-Paid Conversion rate, and more, and arrange them in the order that makes the most sense for your needs. This lets you focus on the metrics that matter most to you and your team.

Plus, the dashboard is saved per user, so you can customize it to your preferences and needs rather than having a one-size-fits-all approach for your entire organization. This makes it easy to stay on top of your app's performance and make data-driven decisions tailored to your needs.

![](/guides/images/docs/c927da7-Screenshot_2023-03-30_at_18.48.22.png)

Once you have activated the cumulative data format, each data point starts representing the total for that metric up to that point in time rather than just the value for that specific period.

Additionally, after choosing the **Line** chart type, the widget displays data of the same length from the previous period. Please note that this feature works only for the following period to display: Current Day, Current Week, Current Month, and Current Year.

# Percentages explained

![](/guides/images/docs/6f11925-Screenshot_2023-03-30_at_18.59.00.png)

One of the features of the dashboard charts is the percentage-based comparison with the previous period of the same length. The value is calculated by following steps:

1. We take the chart's value (a number which is located to the left of the percentage)

2. Compare the value with the one calculated accordingly to the widget's period to display setting:

   1. Current day -> The same day the previous week until the current time
   2. Current week -> Previous week until the current time
   3. Current month -> Previous month until the current time
   4. Current year -> Previous year until the current time
   5. Last day -> 24 hours before "last day"
   6. Last week - > A week before "last week"
   7. Last month -> A month before "last month"
   8. Last year -> A year before "last year"
