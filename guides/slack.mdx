You can send all valuable subscription and in-app purchase events to your Slack workspace. To enable this integration you need to create an app in Slack.

## 1. Create and Set Up Your Slack App

Please refer to the detailed documentation on creating a Slack App [here](https://slack.com/intl/en-ru/help/articles/115005265063-Incoming-webhooks-for-Slack).

1. Create a new Slack app in the workspace where you want to post messages.
2. From the Features page in Slack, toggle Activate Incoming Webhooks on.
3. Click Add New Webhook to Workspace.
4. Pick a channel that the app will post to, then click Authorize.
5. Copy the created webhook URL

## 2. Configure the Slack Integration

1. Navigate to the Integrations section in your Qonversion project and select Slack.
2. Pass the URL to the Webhook URL field.
3. Choose the events to send and edit the event names if needed.

## Event Payload

In case you need details about data sent to Slack, follow the example below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  {
     "channel":"", 
     "username":"",
     "attachments":[
        {
           "fallback":"Subscription Renewed",
           "author_name":"Subscription Renewed",
           "color":"",
           "title":"",
           "title_link":"",
           "footer":"",
           "footer_icon":"",
           "ts":1686432178,
           "fields":[
              {
                 "title":"",
                 "value":"",
                 "short":false
              }
           ]
        }
     ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>
