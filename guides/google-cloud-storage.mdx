Qonversion allows you to upload all the raw revenue data we track to your Google Cloud Storage bucket. You can find more details about raw data reports [here](scheduled-reports).

## Prepare Google Cloud Storage credentials

To upload raw data reports to your bucket, Qonversion needs the service account's key and write access to the corresponding bucket.

1. Navigate to the [IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) in your Google Cloud account and select your project.

2. Create a new service account for the Qonversion file uploader using the *+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT BUTTON*.

10. Congratulations! Now you have finished the preparation steps in the Google Cloud console. The only thing left is to enter the bucket's name and provide previously downloaded private key JSON to Qonversion.

## Enter Google Cloud Storage credentials to Qonversion

1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Storage](https://dash.qonversion.io/app/integration/create?name=google_cloud_storage) integration creation page.

2. Enter data from the private key JSON and the bucket's name to the *Service Account credentials JSON* and *Bucket name* fields, respectively.

   * You have gotten the private key JSON during the 4th step in the *Prepare Google Cloud Storage credentials* above.
   * You have gotten the bucket's name during the 9th step in the *Prepare Google Cloud Storage credentials* above.

3. Click *the Add new integration +* button
