To run the integration, follow the steps below.

## 1. Setup the SDKs

1. Make sure you have CleverTap SDK installed. Check the official CleverTap SDK documentation [here](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/clevertap-sdks).

3. Send *yourSIdeUserId* to Qonversion using [Custom User Properties](user-properties#optional-set-user-id).
