<Warning>
  ### Wait 24 hours before updating your existing key in Qonversion

  It takes up to 24 hours for your [Google service credentials](service-account-key-android) to work correctly. Make sure to wait for at least 24 hours after you have created the credentials before connecting to Google Real-Time Developer Notifications.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Could not connect Qonversion to Google

1. Ensure the provided service access key has Pub/Sub Admin role. Create a new service account key with Pub/Sub Admin role as described [here](service-account-key-android#5-configure-your-service-account)
2. Wait 24 hours
3. Back up your existing key from Qonversion, then update the service key
4. Try again connecting Google to Qonversion
