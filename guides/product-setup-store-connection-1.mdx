# 1. Add Products

*(Optional, but recommended for paywalls)*

If your screen involves in-app purchases or subscriptions, you'll need to create products in your Qonversion project first.

* These products will appear in the Builder’s dropdown for easy linking.
* If you’re only designing onboarding or feature-explainer screens, you can skip this step for now.

You can create products directly from the No-Codes section in your dashboard or from the [Entitlements Section](create-products#/)

To add products for your screen:

1. Go to **Dashboard** → **No-Codes** → **Getting Started**
2. Scroll to the **Add Products** section
3. Click **Add Product** and fill in the details (Product ID, Store, Type, Duration, Price)

# 3. Using Products in the Builder

In the No-Code Builder, you can use products with

In the No-Code Builder, you can use products in several ways:

* **Canvas Settings** – Set a **Default Product** that’s automatically selected when the screen is displayed.
* **Actions** – Components like Containers and Buttons include action settings such as *Make a Purchase* or *Select Product*.
* **Text Variables** – Dynamically insert product **names**, **prices**, or other attributes.

Products will appear automatically in the dropdown, ready to bind:
