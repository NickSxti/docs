## Invalid access token received

* Make sure that you set the correct [Project Key](quickstart#2-create-a-project-and-register-your-app) to the `Qonversion Configuration Builder`.

## Invalid Store Credentials Error

### **`iOS`**

* Please make sure to provide the correct [Shared Secret](app-specific-shared-secret) in the Qonversion Dashboard.
* Please make sure to fill out the tax information and agreement for the paid apps section.

### **`Android`**

* [Check](https://play.google.com/console/developers/users-and-permissions) that your service account registered in the Google Play Console has the necessary account entitlements for Qonversion: **View financial data** and **Manage orders and subscriptions**
* Make some updates in your product's configuration in Google Play Console. For example, edit the product description and save it. It will update Google’s cache.

## Product not found error (ProductNotFound)

### All stores

* Here are the most frequent reasons for receiving a **product not found** error.
* You are trying to buy a product with the wrong Qonversion Product ID or you have not set the product identifiers in the [Qonversion dashboard](create-products).
* You are trying to buy a product with the wrong Google Play Store ID + base plan ID or AppStore Product ID configured on the [Qonversion dashboard](create-products).

### **`App Store only`**

1. Products need to be in **Ready to submit** or **Ready for sale** status.
   1. How to navigate: App Store Connect, select your app, click **Manage** under the In-App Purchases title on the left menu.
2. Your payment and tax agreements in Apple Developer Account should be filled
3. Apple StoreKit returns `invalidProductIdentifiers` and empty products response.

## Missing entitlements after purchase

* In case you are receiving empty or not expected entitlement data:

1. Ensure that products and entitlements are configured correctly in the [Qonversion dashboard](entitlements). Check if the purchased product is linked to the expected entitlement.
2. `iOS Only` Make sure you are not using a `.storekit` file. Products from the `.storekit` file are available only on your local phone or simulator. They are unavailable on the App Store Connect and can’t be validated.
3. `Android Only` If [in-app products](android-in-app-products) are created **before** [granting users access](service-account-key-android#7-grant-access) or [linking Google Cloud Project](service-account-key-android#3-link-google-cloud-project) to the service account, it may cause problems with the receipt validation using Google Play Developer API. Google Play Developer API can return the following error *"The current user has insufficient permissions to perform the requested operation."* When encountering this issue, open the In-app products or Subscription tab respectively on the Google Play Console and make some updates. For example, edit the product description and save it.

# iOS only

## Invalid store product identifiers

Apple StoreKit returns `invalidProductIdentifiers` and empty products response. In this case, you will see this error in the log:

`❌ Invalid store products identifiers: ("some_product_identifier", "some_other_product_identifier")`

There are a few reasons why this error can occur:

1. Your in-app purchases are not configured correctly on the App Store Connect. Check the first point of this section.
2. Your app bundle ID does not match the bundle ID from App Store Connect where purchases were created.
3. You are using `.storekit` file which is configured with other IDs than you are trying to use.
4. You have unfilled payment and tax agreements in your Developer Account
5. Unknown StoreKit issue. In some cases, StoreKit returns invalid store products identifiers without any visible reason. Update the product title in AppStore Connect, wait about 15-30 min, and try to request products in Qonversion SDK again.

## Receipt validation error

Here are the most frequent reasons for SDK `QNAPIErrorReceiptValidation` error:

* Provided shared secret can’t be used for validation. Please, make sure the shared secret you set in the [Qonversion's settings dashboard](https://dash.qonversion.io/project/stores) is correct.
* The receipt is corrupted.
* The receipt was not found on the Apple server.
* Apple Receipt Validation service is temporarily unavailable.

## Operation couldn't be completed with error: 2

* In case you're receiving such an error, make sure that you configured `App Store Bundle ID` at the [Store Settings](https://dash.qonversion.io/project/stores) tab correctly.
* Use a device (not a simulator) when testing iOS purchases.

## Purchase result without dialog window open

In most cases, it happens because of unfinished transactions. If this issue occurs many times in a row, the possible reason is that some transactions can't be finished. Please ensure you didn't delete some AppStore products that were purchased on the current Sandbox account. Create a new sandbox account and test again.

# Android only

## Empty `StoreDetails` (or `SkuDetails`) error

Here are the most frequent reasons for the **StoreDetails** (or **SkuDetails**) error.

1. Your in-app products are not configured correctly in Google Play Console. Once you have created a product, it has an Inactive status. You have to **activate the product** to purchase it. For more details, see our [Android In-App Products Setup](android-in-app-products) guide.
2. Your app has an **application ID different from the original APK uploaded to Google Play Console**. An **applicationIdSuffix** for the debug **buildType** in the build.gradle file may also cause an error. When you use applicationIdSuffix you actually change your applicationId. As a result, Google Play Store treats your app as a completely different app.
3. It could be a problem on the Google side, so we recommend updating the in-app purchase information in the Google Play Console. You can update the in-app purchase description and save it.
4. In case you don't see the changes applied, please try to clear the Google Play Store cache on your test device.

## Billing Unavailable error

The Billing service is unavailable on the device because it is not connected to any Google account at the moment. Here are the possible reasons:

1. You are testing on an emulator. Please make sure that the emulator has the Play Store installed.
2. You are not logged into a test device with a google account.

For more details see [Android test devices](android-test-devices).

## The purchase token does not match the package name

* Ensure that you've inserted your package name correctly in the [Store Settings](https://dash.qonversion.io/project/stores) tab. You can find `applicationID` in your app-level `build.gradle` file.

## Product Unavailable error: The item you requested is not available for purchase

Please make sure that you checked the solutions below:

1. The app's publish mode on the Google Play Console is **Published**. It should not be **Draft**.
2. The uploaded App Bundle or APK file matches the one you are testing, including the following parameters: **versionCode**, **versionName**, **applicationId**, and **keystore signature**.
3. You are not using your developer google account while testing purchases.
4. You have created a test account in the developer console.
5. You have configured the test account as follows:

* You are signed in on your device with your test account.
* For closed alpha/beta testing, you added your test account to the selected testers group. You have been approved to become a tester and accepted participation in the internal app testing via an invite link.

6. Clear the cache data of the Google Play App. If the error persists, then log out & log in to your Google account on the device.

## Purchase Invalid: Proxy of the BillingClient DEVELOPER\_ERROR

Check the following steps to resolve this error:

* Ensure that the uploaded App Bundle or APK file on the Google Play Console matches the one you are testing, including the following parameters: versionCode, version name, applicationId, and keystore signature.
* Make sure that you are not using your developer google account while testing purchases.
* Clear the cache data of the Google Play App. If the error persists, then log out & log in to your Google account on the device.

You can check the details on Developer\_Error in Google developer documentation [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingClient.BillingResponseCode#developer_error).

## Google RTDN is not working or do not connecting

Check the following:

1. Incorrect Pub/Sub Topic Format in Google Play Console You must set the topic in this exact format: projects/YOUR\_PROJECT\_ID/topics/YOUR\_TOPIC\_NAME

2. Missing IAM Permission for Google’s RTDN Publisher Google’s RTDN system must have permission to publish to your topic. Run this:

   ```
   bash
   gcloud pubsub topics add-iam-policy-binding your-topic \
     --member="serviceAccount:[email protected]" \
     --role="roles/pubsub.publisher"
   ```

   If not set, no events will be delivered, and no error will be shown.

3. Pub/Sub Topic Exists in the Wrong GCP Project

   Ensure your topic is in the same Google Cloud project that your Play Console uses.

   Check your active project:

   ```
   gcloud config get-value project
   ```

   Google Play references topics by project ID, not number or display name.

4. GCP Billing Is Disabled or Suspended

   Even if Pub/Sub is free-tier, the project must have billing enabled.

   Go to: [https://console.cloud.google.com/billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)

   And verify: • Your billing account is active • It’s linked to the correct project

5. The issue can be with the "Domain restricted sharing" organization policy in Google Cloud. It might be automatically set to a strict rule. You need to set that to "Google Managed Default."

6. Topic Not Properly Saved in Google Play Console

   Sometimes saving the topic in Monetization setup silently fails.

   Steps:

   1. Go to Monetization > Monetization setup
   2. Check the RTDN section
   3. Ensure the topic is still present after saving
   4. If not, re-enter and save again

7. No Qualifying Events Triggered Yet RTDN only sends events for: • Subscription purchases • Renewals • Cancellations • Grace period changes • Pauses, etc.

8. App Not Published or Package Name Mismatch

   If the app is: • In draft • Not yet released to internal testing • Has a different packageName than what’s configured in Google Play

   RTDN will not activate.

   Fixes: • Push your app to internal or closed testing • Verify your packageName matches exactly

9. Domain Restricted Sharing policy is enabled This policy is enabled by default.

   * adding the domain associated with the user may not work Fixes:
   * remove this policy

10. No Active Pub/Sub Subscription or Message Retention

    Pub/Sub by default drops messages if no subscription exists.

    You need to either:

```
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create your-sub \
  --topic=your-topic
```

Or enable message retention explicitly on the topic.

## Android: setProperty does not work

Why it happens:

Issue with Hlit library

Solution:

Add this to android manifest:

```
<provider android:name="androidx.startup.InitializationProvider" android:authorities="${applicationId}.androidx-startup" android:exported="false" tools:node="merge">

<meta-data android:name="androidx.work.WorkManagerInitializer" android:value="androidx.startup" tools:node="remove">

</provider>
```
