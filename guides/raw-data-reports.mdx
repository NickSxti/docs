## To export the data:

Select [Export Data](http://dash.qonversion.io/export/raw-data) from the menu.

1. Select the period at the top right corner.
2. Select the events sorting option for the export. There are two options available:

* sort by **Transaction date** (date of an event according to app stores)
* sort by **Event receive date** (date of an event detected by Qonversion). Using this option, you can ensure that no new events will appear for the selected period if another export is performed sometime later.

3. Click the **Download** button or send the download link to your email.
