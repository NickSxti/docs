Scheduled reports allow you to automate [raw data export](raw-data-reports). It is helpful to:

* automatically receive raw data for enriching your data infrastructure with subscription events;
* deliver reports to your team on a schedule.

## Configure a Scheduled Report

Select [Scheduled Reports](https://dash.qonversion.io/scheduled-reports) from the menu in your Qonversion account.

Provide the following details to set up your report:

* Report Name – an internal report name for your reference, e.g., "Morning analytics reports";
* Send At – a time when the report will be prepared and sent, 30-minute time intervals available;
* Destination – destination where your report will be sent. The following options are available: Slack, Webhook, or Email.
* Included Range – report period: 1, 3, or 7 days based on the date on which our system receives the event
* Status – draft or active.

Events of what period we will send

* From (Send At - Included Range) to (Send At).

* Example:

  * you set up: Send At: 02:00 UTC, Included range: 3 days
  * on Feb 15 near after 02:00 we send you events from Feb 12 02:00 to Feb 15 02:00

<Info>
  Please note that subscription events in Scheduled Reports are being sorted by event receive date (i.e. the date when Qonversion detected the event)
