Application licensing allows you to set up a list of Gmail accounts to test your in-app purchases. You don't have to add a publishing account here because it is considered a licensed tester by default.

**1. Open License Testing panel** Navigate to [Google Play Developer Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/). Click on the Settings and select the **License Testing** panel. This page lets you set up the main components for test accounts and manage test responses.

**2. License testers** Add the tester account that you will use for testing in-app purchases with an Android device. See more on Android devices for testing [here](android-test-devices).

**3. License response** License response allows you to set a [static licensing response](https://developer.android.com/google/play/licensing/setting-up#test-response) in your publisher account. RESPOND\_NORMALLY affects google server responses when it receives a license check for your application. If the app has a license, the server will respond "LICENSED". Otherwise "NOT\_LICENSED".
