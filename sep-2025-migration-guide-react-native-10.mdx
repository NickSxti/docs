description: "In this major release of the Qonversion React Native SDK, we've made crucial changes to support No-Codes and The New Architecture along with the React 19+ versions."
---

## No-Codes support

Qonversion No-Codes are now officially released! For integration steps, please follow our [documentation](no-codes).

## Upgrading library

We've migrated the library to the Qonversion organization in NPM, so along with the version update, you should also change the name of the library and all the imports.

In your *package.json* file, upgrade the name and the version of the Qonversion SDK:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  // Before
  // "react-native-qonversion": "^9.0.0"

  // Now
  "@qonversion/react-native-sdk": "^10.0.0"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

After upgrading the dependency call `yarn install` to download the library and then upgrade all your imports from the previous version:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  // Before
  // import Qonversion from 'react-native-qonversion'

  // Now
  import Qonversion from '@qonversion/react-native-sdk'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Properties renamings

We've made a couple of renamings of our DTO properties to sync them with the rest codestyle. If you were using these fields, simply upgrade their names as described in the table below

| Old name               | New name               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `Product.qonversionID` | `Product.qonversionId` |
| `Product.storeID`      | `Product.storeId`      |
| `Product.basePlanID`   | `Product.basePlanId`   |
